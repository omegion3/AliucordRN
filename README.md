# Aliucord React Native

Aliucord Rewrite for the new Discord React Native alpha. Unfinished for now, 
you should probably not install this if you don't know what you're doing.

# ⚠ Notice ⚠

This and all projects related to React Native have been abandoned.

> We decided to keep all development on the good old 126.21 version of Discord, which is the last version of Discord that doesn't use React Native framework. It may lack of new features that Discord added in the past year, but we should be able to keep existing functionality and to add some new features. \[...\] Most of our developers just disliked working and using Discord React Native (its performance is really poor and is full of bugs, there are many reasons to just not like it). If you still want to use new Discord with mods, the best choice is nothing, just use vanilla discord (made by discord team.) until we find the new discord mods
